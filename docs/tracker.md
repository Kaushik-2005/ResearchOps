## Session Log

### 2026-08-18

- Topics studied: MCP role, host-client-server architecture, JSON-RPC message types, protocol-version changes, capability discovery, trust boundaries
- Work implemented: Initialized learning and progress docs; created Day 1 project spec and threat model outline
- Work implemented: Reviewed Day 1 theory interactively and clarified stateless protocol versus stateful application design
- Tests executed: None; Day 1 was a theory and documentation milestone
- Results: Day 1 deliverables are present and reviewed: project specification, architecture diagram, and initial threat model
- Results: Learner can explain MCP versus APIs, host/client/server roles, JSON-RPC basics, `server/discover`, protocol statelessness, primitive boundaries, prompt-injection risk, and host approval versus server authorization
- Problems encountered: Local workspace is not a Git repository; shell sandbox helper failed and required unsandboxed reads
- Decisions made: Start with specification-first documentation before writing server code
- Topics to revisit: Exact boundary between tools, resources, prompts, and Tasks once the schema is concrete
- Next action: Begin Day 2 by scaffolding a local FastMCP server and adding mock tools

### 2026-08-19

- Topics studied: MCP Python SDK v2, MCPServer rename from FastMCP, tool registration, stdio transport, structured results, tool-level errors
- Work implemented: Added pyproject.toml, local server scaffold, mock paper data, roadmap entry point, and unit test
- Tests executed: pytest; inline Python verification of direct tool calls; inline SDK client verification for tool listing and invocation
- Results: pytest passed; client listed health_check, search_papers, and get_paper; success and failure cases behaved as expected
- Problems encountered: Sandbox helper failed again; global environment install introduced a `fastapi`/`starlette` dependency conflict risk
- Decisions made: Use current official SDK v2 naming (MCPServer) while documenting the roadmap's older FastMCP term
- Topics to revisit: MCP Inspector workflow and how stdio transport is wired in practice
- Next action: Begin Day 3 by tightening tool design and connecting `search_papers` to a real research API

### 2026-08-20

- Topics studied: focused tool boundaries, action-oriented tool naming, parameter limits, structured outputs, stable identifiers, pagination, actionable errors, and search relevance strategy
- Work implemented: Added OpenAlex client and paper service layer, upgraded search_papers and get_paper to real API-backed behavior, added export_bibtex, and tightened search quality with an exact-first strategy plus stricter OpenAlex paper ID validation
- Tests executed: pytest; live Python checks for OpenAlex-backed search_papers, get_paper, and export_bibtex; MCP-level verification for empty results and invalid input; MCP Inspector verification for all three tools
- Results: Real OpenAlex integration works; BibTeX export works; invalid query returns a clear tool error; empty-result search returns a valid empty list with pagination metadata
- Results: MCP Inspector confirmed search_papers, get_paper, and export_bibtex behave correctly; exact-mode search for Model Context Protocol returned relevant MCP papers rather than unrelated long-tail matches
- Results: Learner can explain why empty results are valid, why stable identifiers matter, why dependency logic belongs in a service layer, and why export_bibtex is a separate tool
- Problems encountered: OpenAlex can resolve misleading IDs like W0000000000 to W0, so missing-paper tests must use truly nonexistent IDs
- Decisions made: Use OpenAlex as the Day 3 paper source instead of CORE; keep citation export as a separate tool rather than overloading get_paper
- Topics to revisit: Additional ranking heuristics if OpenAlex still returns weak long-tail matches for ambiguous queries
- Next action: Begin Day 4 by adding resources and prompt templates on top of the read-only paper server

### 2026-08-21

- Topics studied: service versus repository boundaries, SQLite persistence, transactions, idempotency keys, optimistic note updates, read/write separation, and confirmation-gated deletes
- Work implemented: Added a SQLite repository layer, durable reading lists and notes, audit/idempotency tables, persistent `reading-list://{list_id}` resources, and new write tools: `create_reading_list`, `add_paper_to_list`, `add_note`, `update_note`, and `delete_note`
- Tests executed: `pytest`; MCP Inspector verification for Day 5 write tools and persistent resource reads
- Results: 14 tests passed; service-level tests verified idempotency, optimistic concurrency conflicts, and note preconditions; MCP-level tests verified persistent write flows and stable reading-list resource reads
- Results: MCP Inspector confirmed the Day 5 write tools behave as expected, including retry safety, version checks, and delete confirmation
- Work implemented: Design documentation added in `docs/design.md` with architecture, database, and request-flow diagrams
- Results: Learner can explain repository versus service layers, idempotency versus optimistic concurrency, and why the `reading-list://{list_id}` interface stayed stable while the backing store changed
- Problems encountered: One Day 4 MCP test still expected the old reading-list payload shape after persistence landed; the test was updated to the new persistent resource structure
- Decisions made: Use SQLite via the Python standard library for local persistence and keep the `reading-list://{list_id}` resource shape stable while changing only the backing implementation
- Topics to revisit: How to evolve the SQLite local design into the later remote multi-user architecture
- Next action: Begin Day 6 by building a small Python MCP client for discovery, reads, and tool calls

### 2026-08-23

- Topics studied: Day 6 kickoff; MCP client responsibilities, discovery flow, client-side approval, tool invocation, resource reads, and error handling
- Work implemented: Started Module 3 and reviewed the Day 6 milestone against the current server state
- Tests executed: None yet
- Results: Day 6 has been formally started; implementation pending
- Problems encountered: None
- Decisions made: Begin with a local Python CLI client over stdio before adding remote transport on Day 7
- Topics to revisit: Multiple-server isolation and lazy loading once the first client path works
- Next action: Teach Day 6 concepts, validate understanding, then scaffold the client

### 2026-08-25

- Topics studied: Day 6 client responsibilities, discovery versus initialized request flow, client-side approval, tool-error versus protocol-error handling, and local latency reporting
- Work implemented: Added a reusable Python CLI client in `client/cli.py` and `src/researchops_mcp/client_cli.py`; added a packaged `researchops-client` entry point; added client parsing tests
- Tests executed: `pytest`; `python client/cli.py discover`; `python client/cli.py list-tools`; `python client/cli.py read-resource paper://W7129030749`; `python client/cli.py call-tool get_paper --arg paper_id=W999999999999999`; denied and approved `create_reading_list` client runs; formal close-out verification with `python client/cli.py --yes call-tool create_reading_list --arg name=Day6FormalClose --arg idempotency_key=day6-formal-close-1`
- Results: 18 tests passed; discovery returns server info and capabilities; resource reads work; tool errors are surfaced as tool-level failures; write approval can deny execution; approved writes succeed and return stable list URIs
- Results: Formal Day 6 completion verification passed on 2026-08-25 with `pytest`, successful `discover`, and a successful approved `create_reading_list` client call
- Results: Learner can explain the Day 6 protocol nuance that `discover` must stay separate from the initialized request flow in this local setup
- Problems encountered: The first client version called `initialize()` before `discover()`, which caused a protocol-level error on the local connection; the flow was corrected by keeping `discover` separate from initialized operations
- Decisions made: Keep the Day 6 client on local stdio; use a small explicit write-tool policy until richer server-side annotations exist; keep the packaged implementation under `src/` and leave `client/cli.py` as a thin entry point
- Topics to revisit: Multiple-server isolation, lazy loading, and whether later server metadata should replace the local write-tool policy table
- Next action: Begin Day 7 by adding Streamable HTTP transport and preparing for remote-style verification

### 2026-08-25 Day 7 Kickoff

- Topics studied: Day 7 kickoff; Streamable HTTP transport, stateless remote serving, containerization, and deployment prerequisites
- Work implemented: Reviewed the roadmap, current server transport shape, packaging, and missing deployment files before starting Day 7
- Tests executed: None yet for Day 7
- Results: Confirmed Day 7 starts from a stdio-only server; no `Dockerfile` exists yet
- Problems encountered: None
- Decisions made: Start by teaching the Day 7 transport model before adding HTTP server code
- Topics to revisit: Exact SDK HTTP serving API and how to test remote Inspector against the local staging shape
- Next action: Teach Day 7 concepts, validate understanding, then add Streamable HTTP support
- Work implemented: Added Render deployment preparation including `render.yaml`, env-aware `PORT` and `DATABASE_PATH` settings, and `.dockerignore` for a smaller Docker build context
- Tests executed: `pytest`; `python src/server.py --help`; generated `render.yaml` reviewed for free Docker web-service settings
- Results: 24 tests passed; server now reads Render-style environment variables; the container and server startup are ready for a free Render web service using temporary SQLite at `/tmp/researchops.db`
- Topics to revisit: Real non-local Render URL verification and supported AI host connection still remain before Day 7 can be marked complete

### 2026-08-25 Day 7 Closeout

- Topics studied: Remote Streamable HTTP verification, free-host cold starts, Render staging behavior, and ephemeral deployment storage boundaries
- Work implemented: Completed Day 7 deployment verification against the public Render endpoint at `https://researchops-mcp.onrender.com/mcp`
- Tests executed: `pytest`; `python client/cli.py --connection-mode http --server-url https://researchops-mcp.onrender.com/mcp discover`; `python client/cli.py --connection-mode http --server-url https://researchops-mcp.onrender.com/mcp list-tools`; `python client/cli.py --connection-mode http --server-url https://researchops-mcp.onrender.com/mcp call-tool health_check`; `python client/cli.py --connection-mode http --server-url https://researchops-mcp.onrender.com/mcp call-tool search_papers --arg "query=Model Context Protocol" --arg "limit=2"`
- Results: Remote discovery returned server `researchops-mcp`, version `0.5.0`, and protocol `2026-07-28`; remote tool listing exposed the expected 9 tools with schemas and read/write boundaries
- Results: Remote `health_check` confirmed OpenAlex plus SQLite with staging database path `/tmp/researchops.db`; remote `search_papers` returned live upstream OpenAlex results through the deployed MCP server
- Problems encountered: Early retries intermittently returned `Not Found` before later succeeding, consistent with free Render cold-start or routing wake-up behavior rather than a persistent MCP routing defect
- Decisions made: Accept temporary `/tmp/researchops.db` storage for Day 7 staging only and carry persistent remote storage as a later production concern
- Topics to revisit: Supported AI host connection and persistent remote database strategy after authentication work begins
- Next action: Start Day 8 by adding authentication and authorization boundaries for remote access

### 2026-08-27 Day 8 Kickoff

- Topics studied: Authentication versus authorization, OAuth 2.1 roles, protected resource metadata, scopes, token audience, and tenant ownership boundaries
- Work implemented: Reviewed the roadmap, current tracker state, current learning notes, and current code paths for user ownership and remote transport
- Tests executed: None yet for Day 8
- Results: Confirmed the repository already stores `user_id`, but the service still uses one default local user and the remote server does not yet enforce real authentication, scopes, or `401` and `403` responses
- Problems encountered: None
- Decisions made: Start Day 8 from the existing single-user ownership hooks rather than redesigning persistence from scratch
- Topics to revisit: Exact SDK support for auth middleware, protected resource metadata exposure, and how strict the first local auth simulation should be
- Next action: Teach Day 8 concepts, validate understanding, then implement the first authenticated request path

### 2026-08-27 Day 8 Closeout

- Topics studied: Authentication versus authorization, OAuth 2.1 roles, PKCE, protected resource metadata, resource indicators, scopes, and tenant ownership enforcement
- Work implemented: Added Day 8 auth helpers, demo bearer-token verification, per-scope enforcement, HTTP auth configuration, and user-aware list and note ownership checks through the service and repository layers
- Work implemented: Extended the CLI to send bearer tokens for HTTP transport and added dedicated Day 8 auth tests for `401` and `403` behavior
- Tests executed: `pytest tests/unit/test_http_auth.py`; `pytest`; local HTTP CLI checks with `researchops-bob-read`, `researchops-alice-read`, `researchops-alice-full`, and no token
- Results: 32 tests passed; missing or invalid bearer tokens return `401`; insufficient write scope returns `403`; cross-user list access is blocked; authenticated owners can still read and write their own data
- Results: Learner can explain authentication versus authorization, `401` versus `403`, and why scope alone is not enough without ownership checks
- Problems encountered: The CLI currently summarizes some raw HTTP auth failures as generic transport errors instead of always surfacing the exact HTTP status cleanly
- Decisions made: Use the official MCP SDK auth surface with demo tokens now, and keep ownership enforcement in the repository layer rather than only at the MCP boundary
- Topics to revisit: Full external OAuth provider integration, token refresh, and cleaner client-side surfacing of remote auth failures
- Next action: Begin Day 9 security hardening with outbound controls, validation limits, audit review, and adversarial testing

### 2026-08-29 Day 9 Kickoff

- Topics studied: Day 9 kickoff; prompt injection, tool poisoning, tool shadowing, confused-deputy attacks, SSRF, data exfiltration, validation, rate limiting, and audit boundaries
- Work implemented: Reviewed the roadmap, tracker, learning notes, current Day 8 auth state, and current codebase before starting security hardening
- Tests executed: None yet for Day 9
- Results: Confirmed Day 8 is complete and the earliest incomplete milestone is Day 9 MCP security
- Problems encountered: None
- Decisions made: Start Day 9 from the current authenticated multi-user server instead of redesigning transport or auth again
- Topics to revisit: Which protections belong in transport middleware versus tool handlers versus downstream services
- Next action: Teach Day 9 security concepts, validate understanding, then implement the first hardening slice

### 2026-08-29 Day 9 Closeout

- Topics studied: prompt injection, tool poisoning, confused deputy, outbound allowlists, request-size limits, rate limiting, logging hygiene, and trust labeling for model-facing content
- Work implemented: Added `security.py` with outbound-domain checks, request-size middleware, rate limiting middleware, and log redaction helpers; tightened OpenAlex, prompt, resource, and note validation; added untrusted-content warnings to paper and reading-list resources and prompt templates; fixed HTTP startup to mount the ASGI app with custom middleware via `uvicorn`
- Tests executed: `pytest tests/unit/test_security_controls.py`; `pytest`; manual HTTP CLI checks against `http://127.0.0.1:8012/mcp` for `read-resource paper://W7129030749`, `get-prompt compare_papers`, repeated `discover` calls with a short rate-limit window, and prior Day 8 ownership and scope checks under auth
- Results: 8 dedicated Day 9 security tests passed and the full suite passed with 40 tests; paper resources now mark external metadata as untrusted, prompt templates add an explicit security note, oversize input is rejected, and non-OpenAlex outbound targets are blocked
- Results: Manual verification confirmed `paper://W7129030749` includes `content_trust=untrusted_external_data` and a `security_warning`; `compare_papers` preserved the hostile focus string as data while warning not to follow untrusted content as instructions; repeated authenticated requests hit the configured rate limit and were rejected at the HTTP layer
- Results: Learner can explain why host approval is not enough, how ownership and scope differ, why rate limiting is about abuse control rather than identity, and why paper metadata and notes must be treated as untrusted content
- Problems encountered: The first Day 9 HTTP startup attempt incorrectly passed custom middleware settings into `MCPServer.run(...)`, which raised `TypeError: MCPServer.run_streamable_http_async() got an unexpected keyword argument 'max_http_body_bytes'`; the server entry point was corrected to create the ASGI app and run it with `uvicorn`
- Decisions made: Keep Day 9 hardening lightweight and in-process for now instead of introducing Redis, a WAF, or an external API gateway before the roadmap requires them
- Topics to revisit: Replace in-memory rate limiting with a distributed limiter for multi-instance production deployment and improve CLI surfacing of raw HTTP 429 responses
- Next action: Begin Day 10 by making dependency failures, retries, and degradation paths predictable

### 2026-08-31 Day 10 Kickoff

- Topics studied: Day 10 kickoff; timeout budgets, retries, backoff with jitter, circuit breakers, caching, graceful degradation, and dependency-failure testing
- Work implemented: Reviewed the roadmap, tracker, Day 9 code, and current dependency boundaries before starting reliability work
- Tests executed: None yet for Day 10
- Results: Confirmed the earliest incomplete milestone is Day 10 reliability engineering
- Problems encountered: None
- Decisions made: Start Day 10 from the existing OpenAlex dependency path and persistent library workflows instead of introducing new product features
- Topics to revisit: Which operations are safe to retry automatically and where caching should live
- Next action: Teach Day 10 reliability concepts, validate understanding, then implement the first resilience slice

### 2026-09-01 Day 10 Closeout

- Topics studied: timeout budgets, deadline budgets, retries with backoff and jitter, circuit breakers, cached fallback, and graceful degradation
- Work implemented: Added timeout, retry, deadline, and circuit-breaker behavior to the OpenAlex client; added SQLite cached-paper reads and writes; added stale-cache fallback for stable-ID paper retrieval; exposed reliability settings through server flags and `health_check`
- Tests executed: `pytest tests/unit/test_openalex_service.py`; `pytest`; `python src/server.py --help`; `python client/cli.py call-tool health_check`
- Results: 9 dedicated Day 10 reliability tests passed and the full suite passed with 44 tests; targeted tests verified retry success, circuit-breaker opening, cached stale-paper fallback, and hard failure when no cache exists
- Results: Manual verification on 2026-09-01 confirmed the new reliability flags are exposed by `python src/server.py --help` and the running server reports the configured timeout, deadline, retry, and breaker settings through `health_check`
- Results: Learner can explain why `get_paper` is a safer cache candidate than `search_papers`, why a circuit breaker should fail fast after repeated upstream failure, and why writes should not be retried casually
- Problems encountered: No Inspector-visible fault-injection path exists yet for forcing OpenAlex failures manually; reliability evidence is currently strongest in automated tests plus `health_check` runtime verification
- Decisions made: Limit automatic retry and cached fallback to safe OpenAlex read paths rather than applying the same policy to writes or query-search result caching
- Topics to revisit: Whether later evaluation or observability work should add explicit stale-response metrics and a manual failure simulator
- Next action: Begin Day 11 protocol and application testing


### 2026-09-02 Day 11 Closeout

- Topics studied: unit versus integration versus contract testing, metadata regression, MCP-shaped error handling, external API mocking, and Inspector-based verification
- Work implemented: Added `tests/integration/test_protocol_workflows.py` for end-to-end MCP workflow and error-result coverage; added `tests/unit/test_mcp_metadata_regression.py` to freeze the discovered tool, prompt, and resource-template contract
- Tests executed: `pytest tests/integration/test_protocol_workflows.py tests/unit/test_mcp_metadata_regression.py`; `pytest`; `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest --cli python src/server.py --method tools/list --format json`
- Results: The new Day 11 suite passed with 6 tests and the full suite passed with 51 tests on 2026-09-02; integration coverage now verifies successful tool flows, resource updates after writes, prompt rendering, and MCP-shaped HTTP error results
- Results: Inspector CLI listed the expected 9 tools from the current local server, confirming the external MCP-visible contract still matches the automated metadata regression checks
- Results: Learner can explain why schema drift is a contract problem, why error-result shape matters in MCP, and why mocks are useful beyond speed or quota control
- Problems encountered: `docs/session-handoff.md` was missing at session start; the first raw integration assertion assumed full note content in reading-list resources, but the actual contract intentionally exposes only `content_preview`; local Node is `v22.14.0`, below the Inspector docs recommendation of `22.19.0+`, so the latest Inspector emitted engine warnings even though CLI verification still succeeded
- Decisions made: Keep Day 11 metadata regression focused on contract-critical fields rather than freezing every byte of every MCP response
- Topics to revisit: Whether to add broader compatibility checks across future SDK or protocol-version changes once Day 12 evaluation work begins
- Next action: Begin Day 12 by defining the evaluation dataset, expected tool behaviors, and quality thresholds

### 2026-09-04 Day 12 Closeout

- Topics studied: tool-call precision and recall, argument correctness, task-completion rate, hallucinated-tool rate, unauthorized-action rate, latency percentiles, metadata quality thresholds, and evaluation regression design
- Work implemented: Added `src/researchops_mcp/evals.py`, a 42-case JSONL evaluation dataset, focused Day 12 unit tests, machine-readable and human-readable evaluation reports, and a minimal GitHub Actions regression workflow for evals
- Tests executed: `pytest tests/unit/test_eval_runner.py`; `python -m researchops_mcp.evals --fail-on-thresholds`
- Results: 5 Day 12 unit tests passed on 2026-09-04; the current metadata variant passed all thresholds with precision 1.0, recall 1.0, argument correctness 0.971, exact match 1.0, unauthorized-action rate 0.0, and p95 latency 162 ms
- Results: The generic-description variant performed materially worse, demonstrating that MCP tool names and descriptions are part of operational model behavior rather than only documentation
- Problems encountered: The Windows sandbox helper was missing again, so verification and file updates required unsandboxed execution; the first eval-runner rewrite briefly introduced a regex quoting bug that was corrected before final verification
- Decisions made: Keep Day 12 evaluation deterministic with a fake paper service and compare the current metadata against an intentionally degraded metadata variant
- Topics to revisit: Whether later model-backed evaluation should supplement this deterministic harness with result-grounding and cost-per-task measurement
- Next action: Begin Day 13 by adding observability primitives, request IDs, and per-tool telemetry

### 2026-09-05 Day 13 Closeout

- Topics studied: structured logging, request IDs, metrics per operation, success and failure rates, latency percentiles, dependency latency, PII-safe telemetry, health/readiness checks, OpenTelemetry API spans, and CI expansion
- Work implemented: Added `src/researchops_mcp/observability.py`; instrumented MCP tools, resources, prompts, HTTP requests, and OpenAlex dependency calls; exposed `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`, and observability data in `health_check`; added focused observability tests; added `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; created `docs/session-handoff.md`
- Tests executed: `pytest tests/unit/test_observability.py`; `pytest tests/unit/test_observability.py tests/unit/test_openalex_service.py`; `python -m compileall src tests`; `pytest`; `python -m researchops_mcp.evals --fail-on-thresholds`; `docker build -t researchops-mcp:day13 .`
- Results: 5 observability tests passed; 14 focused observability/OpenAlex tests passed; full suite passed with 61 tests; eval threshold gate passed; Docker image build succeeded on 2026-09-05
- Problems encountered: The Windows sandbox helper remained unavailable, so several reads and edits required escalated execution; `apply_patch` worked for new files but failed for some existing-file updates
- Decisions made: Use stdlib JSON logging and in-process metrics with OpenTelemetry API spans now, while deferring exporter/collector setup until production configuration is justified
- Topics to revisit: Add a real OpenTelemetry SDK exporter and external metrics backend if the project is deployed beyond local/staging use
- Next action: Begin Day 14 final release work: final security review, release checklist, demo path, known limitations, and portfolio packaging
### 2026-09-05 CI Regression Fix

- Topics studied: Runtime dependency declarations versus locally installed transitive dependencies
- Work implemented: Added explicit `httpx>=0.27.0` to project dependencies because `researchops_mcp.client_cli` imports `httpx` directly for Streamable HTTP client mode
- Tests executed: `python -m pip install -e .[dev]`; `pytest tests/unit/test_client_cli.py`; `pytest`; `python -m researchops_mcp.evals --fail-on-thresholds`; `docker build -t researchops-mcp:day13 .`
- Results: CI-equivalent install now includes `httpx`; the previously failing CLI test file passed with 6 tests; full suite passed with 61 tests; evaluation gate passed with p95 latency 202 ms under the 250 ms threshold; Docker image build installed `httpx` in the container
- Problems encountered: Local development had `httpx` installed already, so the missing dependency only appeared in clean CI
- Decisions made: Keep `httpx` as a runtime dependency instead of a dev-only dependency because HTTP client mode is part of the shipped CLI
- Topics to revisit: Consider a future clean-venv CI smoke test if dependency drift recurs
- Next action: Continue Day 14 final release work
### 2026-09-06 Day 14 Kickoff And Release Packaging

- Topics studied: elicitation and multi-round-trip requests, long-running Tasks, MCP Apps/UI resources, extensions, tool-list caching, compatibility policy, deprecation strategy, and final release packaging
- Work implemented: Added `docs/release-checklist.md` and `docs/demo-script.md`; updated README, learning notes, design docs, threat model, decisions, questions, and session handoff for Day 14 release posture
- Tests executed: `python -m compileall src tests`; `pytest`; `python -m researchops_mcp.evals --fail-on-thresholds`; `docker build -t researchops-mcp:release .`
- Results: Syntax verification passed; full suite passed with 61 tests; evaluation gate passed with p95 latency 153 ms under the 250 ms threshold; release Docker image build completed after Docker Desktop was started
- Problems encountered: Docker Desktop Linux engine was initially unavailable, then the user started Docker and confirmed the release image build finished
- Decisions made: Do not implement demo-only Tasks or MCP Apps; document them as future extensions because the current product does not yet have a genuine long-running workflow or UI workflow that justifies the added complexity
- Topics to revisit: Choose a post-roadmap production upgrade such as real OAuth, durable storage, external telemetry, distributed controls, or a genuine Task workflow
- Next action: Record a demo using `docs/demo-script.md` or start a post-roadmap production upgrade
