# ResearchOps MCP Threat Model

## Scope

This started as the Day 1 threat-model outline for the ResearchOps MCP project.
It has now been extended through Day 14 to reflect authenticated remote access, scoped authorization, trust labeling, outbound restrictions, request-size enforcement, rate limiting, dependency-failure resilience, observability controls, final release limitations, and future Tasks/Apps risks.

## Assets

- User identity and authorization context
- Reading lists and research notes
- API credentials for external research providers
- Server configuration and secrets
- Audit records
- Availability of the MCP service
- Prompt and resource content presented to the model

## Entry Points

- Local `stdio` requests
- Remote Streamable HTTP requests
- Tool arguments
- Resource reads
- Prompt arguments
- External research API responses
- Deployment logs and audit output

## Trust Boundaries

- Between the host and the MCP client
- Between the MCP client and the MCP server
- Between the MCP server and external APIs
- Between the MCP server and persistent storage
- Between operators and deployed infrastructure
- Between model-facing context and model control instructions

## Threats

### Prompt injection and tool poisoning

- Malicious paper titles, abstracts, or notes may try to manipulate the model.
- Tool descriptions, prompt arguments, or returned content may be over-trusted by the host or model.
- Hostile focus text may try to override the reusable prompt template.

### Unauthorized access

- A caller may attempt to read another user's lists or notes.
- A caller may attempt writes without approval or correct scope.
- A caller may present a valid token for the wrong resource server.
- A caller may have a broad read scope but still target another tenant's private data.

### Input abuse

- Oversized queries, notes, or prompt arguments may try to exhaust memory, storage, or context.
- Unexpected fields or malformed identifiers may probe validation weaknesses.
- Large HTTP request bodies may try to pressure parsing or request handling.

### External dependency abuse

- SSRF-like behavior can occur if later tools accept arbitrary URLs.
- Research APIs may return hostile or malformed data.
- Upstream dependencies may be used as an amplifier if request volume is not controlled.

### Secrets and data leakage

- Logs may accidentally capture credentials, idempotency keys, or private notes.
- Returned content may expose more data than necessary.
- Prompt templates could accidentally surface untrusted content without warning.

### Availability risks

- Upstream timeouts and rate limits may stall requests.
- Expensive or repeated searches may create backpressure or denial-of-service conditions.
- One authenticated caller may monopolize the service without additional abuse controls.
- Repeated retries without backoff can amplify an upstream outage.
- Missing cache semantics can make degraded responses misleading.

## Initial Mitigations

- Use explicit schemas with constrained inputs
- Enforce authorization in server handlers and persistence layer
- Bound request and response sizes
- Add outbound allowlists for external domains
- Redact secrets and sensitive fields in logs
- Add timeouts and safe retry rules
- Audit every consequential write

## Day 8 Auth State

- Remote HTTP access now requires bearer-token authentication when auth is enabled.
- The current learning implementation uses deterministic demo tokens for Alice and Bob instead of a full external OAuth provider.
- Scopes currently enforced:
  - `papers:read`
  - `lists:read`
  - `lists:write`
  - `notes:write`
- Ownership is enforced at the repository query level so a caller cannot read or mutate another user's lists or notes just by having a coarse scope.
- Verified Day 8 behaviors:
  - missing or invalid bearer token returns `401 Unauthorized`
  - insufficient scope returns `403 Forbidden`
  - cross-user reading-list access is denied

## Day 9 Security State

### Controls Added

- outbound allowlist enforcement for the OpenAlex client
- request-size middleware for Streamable HTTP requests
- fixed-window in-memory rate limiting by caller token or client address
- stricter length bounds for search queries, prompt focus and objective, list metadata, and note content
- `content_trust` and `security_warning` fields on model-facing resources
- security note injection in prompt templates
- recursive redaction for sensitive log fields

### Verified Behaviors On August 29, 2026

- `paper://W7129030749` returns truncated paper context plus `content_trust=untrusted_external_data`
- paper resources and prompt templates include explicit warnings that external metadata and user notes are untrusted
- hostile focus text passed into `compare_papers` is preserved as data but framed with a security warning
- repeated authenticated requests can be rejected by the configured HTTP rate limit
- oversized request bodies are rejected by middleware in automated tests
- non-allowlisted outbound targets are rejected in automated tests

## Day 10 Reliability State

### Controls Added

- per-attempt OpenAlex timeout budget
- overall deadline budget across retries
- exponential backoff with jitter for safe upstream reads
- process-local circuit breaker for repeated upstream failure
- SQLite-backed cached paper fallback for stable-ID lookups

### Verified Behaviors On September 1, 2026

- `pytest tests/unit/test_openalex_service.py` passed with retry, breaker, stale-cache fallback, and no-cache failure coverage
- full `pytest` passed with 44 tests
- `python src/server.py --help` listed the new reliability flags
- `python client/cli.py call-tool health_check` returned the configured timeout, deadline, retry, and breaker settings

## Remaining Day 11+ Security And Reliability Gaps

- The demo token verifier is not a production identity system.
- The current rate limiter is not shared across multiple service instances.
- The current circuit breaker is also process-local.
- The CLI still collapses some raw HTTP auth or rate-limit failures into generic transport errors.
- No external API gateway, WAF, or distributed abuse-control layer is in place yet.
- The outbound allowlist currently protects the OpenAlex client only; future networked tools will need the same discipline.
- Search-result caching semantics are not designed yet.

## Open Questions

- How much user identity will be trusted from the host versus verified directly?
- Which operations need human approval in the client versus strict denial in the server?
- When the project becomes multi-instance, which shared store should back rate limiting, circuit breaking, and broader abuse controls?
## Day 14 Final Release Security Position

### Additional Risks Reviewed

- Long-running Tasks would need authorization checks on task creation, task status, task result retrieval, and cancellation.
- Task IDs must not become bearer secrets; ownership must still be checked server-side.
- MCP Apps would introduce active UI rendering, links, user interaction, and frontend data-exposure risks beyond plain JSON/text results.
- Tool-list caching can cause clients to act on stale metadata if capabilities are renamed or schemas change without a migration plan.
- Public demo deployments can be mistaken for full production if demo auth, disposable storage, and process-local controls are not documented.

### Final Release Mitigations

- Tasks and Apps are not enabled in this release; they are documented as future extensions with explicit security concerns.
- Compatibility policy treats MCP metadata as public contract and requires migration notes for breaking changes.
- Known limitations are documented in `README.md` and `docs/release-checklist.md`.
- Final verification includes syntax checks, full tests, evaluation threshold gate, and Docker image build.

### Remaining Production Gaps

- Replace demo bearer tokens with a real OAuth/OIDC provider.
- Replace disposable staging storage with durable managed storage.
- Move rate limiting and circuit-breaker state to shared infrastructure for multi-instance deployments.
- Export OpenTelemetry spans and metrics to an external collector/backend.
- Add deeper readiness checks for database and dependency health.
